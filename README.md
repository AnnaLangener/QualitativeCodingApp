## Shiny App to Code Qualitative ESM data

Here we provide a shiny app that can be used by other researchers to
code qualitative ESM data based on a given coding scheme. It contains
several columns showing the raw observation (see screenshots below
“activity_open”), the given code (“Code”), and additional information
(such as feelings or who the activity was with). Our codes have a
hierarchical structure and are therefore displayed in different colors.

The code appears interactively as you type.

To use this app, please download and open the app.R file. If desired,
you can also download a codebook. We currently provide two options, one
based on Stadel et al. 2024 (see
<https://annalangener.github.io/QualitativeVis/>) and one based on
Skimina et al. 2020 (see
<https://annalangener.github.io/QualitativeVis/Skimina.html>). It is
also possible to use your own codebook.

The ap runs locally, so there are no privacy concerns when using it.
